# MyBlogs

## Overview  
**MyBlogs** is a simple blog application that enables users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blogs. While currently functioning without a database, the app features a clean and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with templating powered by **EJS**.
